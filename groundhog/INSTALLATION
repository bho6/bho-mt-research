Motivation:
  This guide was created because the traditional process of using brew and pip
  to install GroundHog results in various errors on the invocation of
  dlopen(/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/tables/utilsextension.so, 2). This
  document assumes the reader has working installations of Theano, NumPy, and
  SciPy.

Versions of Dependencies Used:
  - OS X: 10.10.2 (Yosemite)
  - Python: 2.7.6
  - NumPy: 1.9.2
  - SciPy: 0.13.0b1
  - numexpr: 2.4.4
  - Theano: 0.7.0
  - HDF5: 1.8.15-patch1
  - tables: 2.4.0
  - GroundHog: commit 4d2433b

Instructions:
  1. Ensure that you already have Python, NumPy, SciPy, Theano, and numexpr
     installed. This can be done through pip without any issue.

  2. GroundHog relies on the HDF5 library. Unfortunately, as previously alluded
     to in 'motivation', brew install hdf5 and port install hdf5 do not work in
     OS X Yosemite for GroundHog. We must install it directly from source.
    
    - Get the source from:
      http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/hdf5-1.8.15-patch1.tar

    - Follow the instructions in the README, but the short version is to untar
      the directory and run this sequence of commands:
      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5
      make
      make check
      sudo make install
      sudo make check-install

      Once this is done, verify that HDF5 was installed by running
      '/usr/local/hdf5/bin/h5cc -showconfig'.

  3. Now that GroundHog is installed, we must install the PyTables module. This
     is required by GroundHog. Again, the traditional 'pip install tables' does
     not work, so we must download from source.

    - IMPORTANT: The KEY INSIGHT HERE is that we need to install Pytables
      version 2.4.0, and NOT THE LATEST VERSION of 3.2.0. Get from:
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytables/files/pytables/2.4.0/tables-2.4.0.tar.gz/download

    - Follow the instructions in the README, but the short version is to untar
      the dirctory and run: sudo python setup.py install

    - Verify that HDFS was installed by starting a Python interactive shell and
      running 'import tables'.

  4. Now checkout the latest GroundHog source from:
     https://github.com/lisa-groundhog/GroundHog

     - Install by typing sudo 'python setup.py develop'.

     - Verify that the installation worked by 'import groundhog' in a Python
       intaractive shell.

  5. Now everything should be set up. Try working through the neural MT
     experiment in the experiment/ directory.
